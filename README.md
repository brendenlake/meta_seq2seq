# PyTorch implementation of Meta Sequence-to-Sequence Learning

Meta seq2seq learning is a form of memory-based meta learning for seq2seq models. Vanilla neural nets struggle with compositionality, but they can be improved through training on a series of seq2seq problems to acquire the compositional skills needed for solving new problems.
